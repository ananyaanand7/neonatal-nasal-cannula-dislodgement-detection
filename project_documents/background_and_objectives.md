**Problem Statement: The Nasal Cannula Situation in Uganda** 
In the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) in Makerere University Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, nasal cannulas deliver oxygen to neonates, which is critical for neonatal survival. Consequently, our clients and users – the nurses and staff at Makerere University Hospital – need an affordable solution to prevent and detect neonatal cannula dislodgement. 

**Status Quo of Current Solutions**
No fully effective solution currently exists for either the prevention or detection of nasal cannula dislodgement in Uganda. Nasal cannulas frequently become dislodged as a result of the infant’s natural movements or even by active infant removal. While adhesives such as medical tape might be ideal solutions in developed countries, neonates have extremely sensitive skin that could be damaged if the nasal cannulas were taped down with the available resources in Uganda. Additionally, mittens cannot be used to restrain the infant’s hands due to cultural differences.

Furthermore, Uganda is predicted to face a shortage of 30000 to 40000 nurses by 2030 [1]. This leads to problems with detection, as nurses are simply unable to see if a cannula becomes dislodged with 15 infants per nurse. Moreover, creating effective alarm and detection systems remains difficult, as the SCBU in Makerere University Hospital often functions with a variety of background noises from medical machines and other operations. This setting makes it unlikely that nurses or NICU staff would hear an audio-based detection system. 

The oxygen-delivery crisis that prevails in Uganda leaves many young lives at stake. Nasal cannula dislodgement increases the risk of neonatal hypoxia, which can prove fatal over extended periods of time. Furthermore, neonates who experience hypoxic conditions remain at an increased risk of abnormal and impaired brain development [2]. In addition to neonatal risks, cannula dislodgement places a disproportionate workload on SCBU nurses who are already understaffed. Nasal cannula dislodgement can even increase hospital costs, as dislodgement can lead to longer and thus more expensive hospitalizations.

**Functions of the Solution** 
To remedy the situation in Uganda, an ideal nasal cannula solution should be able to do the following:
Successfully alert nurses and NICU staff in the event that a nasal cannula becomes dislodged or removed 
Remain safe for the neonates, who are especially vulnerable to any adverse effects of the device
Remain affordable and be easily accessible in a low resource environment

Detection of nasal cannula dislodgement was prioritized over prevention as the design team believed that a reliable detection device was a safer alternative for the neonates compared to prevention. In the event that a prevention-centered device fails, the neonate is immediately in danger without any way of alerting the nurses. However, a reliable detection device would alert nurses if the cannula becomes dislodged in nearly all scenarios, protecting the infant even if the cannula becomes dislodged. 

**Constraints and Objectives for the Project Design**
The design objectives for the device in descending order of importance are as follows:
  - Speed of dislodgement detection 
  - Ability to accurately detect cannula dislodgement
  - Affordability 
  - Reusability
  - Durability
  - User Friendliness

There are also multiple firm constraints that must be met:
  - Safety of the infants in contact with the device
  - Availability of the device materials in Uganda
  - Cultural Sensitivity
  - Size 

The design criteria chart (Appendix, Table 1) provides specific target values, information, and justifications for each objective and constraint. The pairwise comparison chart (Appendix, Table 2) was used to determine the relative importance of each objective and systematically rank each one.
